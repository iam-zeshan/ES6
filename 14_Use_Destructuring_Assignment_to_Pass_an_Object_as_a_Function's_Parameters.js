/*
We can also use Destructuring of an Object inside a function and assign values of that Object with the variables, by passing that Object as a function's parameters.

Task:
Use destructuring assignment within the argument to the function half to send only max and min inside the function.


const stats = {
  max: 56.78,
  standard_deviation: 4.34,
  median: 34.54,
  mode: 23.87,
  min: -0.75,
  average: 35.85
};

// Only change code below this line
const half = (stats) => (stats.max + stats.min) / 2.0; 
// Only change code above this line
